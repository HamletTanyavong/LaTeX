## About

This LaTeX template contains packages and configurations I regularly use. It is subject to change, and versions will be tagged accordingly. Feel free to use this template for your own projects.

## Setup

First, make sure you have a LaTeX distribution such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive) installed. Next, install the [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) extension for Visual Studio Code. Click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository, and clone it to your local machine. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code and start editing.

## Templates

Templates are located in the templates folder. You may choose to delete any you do not need as they are independent of each other.

- Notes: This is a general-purpose template, mainly used for taking notes or completing assignments.

### Customization

Feel free to create your own preambles and bibliographies and add them to their respective folders. These can be imported into your document using `\import{../../Preambles}{my-preamble.tex}` and `\addbibresource{../../Bibliographies/my-bibliography.bib}`.

## Contributing

If you would like to submit a template to this repository, please create an issue so we can discuss it. Not all templates will be accepted.
